\section{The Preamble}



\subsection{What's a preamble?}

The preamble to a LaTeX document consists of everything before \texttt{\textbackslash begin{document}} is called, and must begin with a \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass{}} call. The default document class in this template is \texttt{article}, but you may change it as you wish.

\subsection{Using preamble.tex}

In this folder, there is a ``preamble.tex'' file that contains formatting and layout packages and settings. This bit of the README goes over what's in there: 


\subsubsection{Formatting}

Packages: \texttt{geometry, parskip, indentfirst, fontspec}

1. \texttt{geometry}

    The package \texttt{geometry} provides settings related to page layout and size. The default setting for this template is \texttt{[margin = 1in]}, providing 1in margins all around. 

    Some useful package options to know are: 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{left, right, top, bottom}: These will set the margins individually. Use the same syntax as \texttt{[margin = 1in]}, so \texttt{[left = 1in]}
    \end{itemize}
